      <h1><b>Title:</b> Rumination/Innovation</h1>
      <p>
        <b>About:</b> Books in black and white (Rumination) and paint containers
        in red and gold (Innovation). Pastel on paper.
      </p>

        <b>Reflection:</b> I wish I would have chosen a subject I was more
        passionate about, but I'm still pleased with the result. More than
        anything this was an experiment with a new medium, paper, and linework.
        I'm pleased with how it turned out given the novelty of the elements of
        this work.
