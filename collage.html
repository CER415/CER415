      <h1><b>Title:</b> Collage</h1>
      <p>
        <b>About:</b> Four pieces with different linework depicting important
        facets of personality and past. Pencil on paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Reflection:</b> These are possibly the pieces I'm most proud of. I
        learned new hatching techniques which improved my understanding of
        structure and light. These pieces were the first ones where I felt I
        captured something emotional and personal in my work, and I will carry
        that lesson with me throughout my future work.
