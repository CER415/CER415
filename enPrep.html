        <b>Reflection:</b> This was my final piece for the class. Although I
        don't think I captured the "self portrait" prompt, I am incredibly proud
        of this piece. It conveys a murkiness and stillness that the focus
        before a bout brings. I loved experimenting with linework, researching
        styles, and being intentional with my marks. It was also an incredibly
        fun piece to make, playing with light, texture, and shadow along with
        different levels of structure in the figure.
