      <h1><b>Title:</b> Diptych</h1>
      <p>
        <b>About:</b> Pothos plant placed on top of books on music stand.
        Positive and negative charcoal fills. Incense also included in positive
        fill.

        <b>Reflection:</b> I adjusted my placements and composition improving as
        I went. I was quite the perfecitonist with these pieces, taking longer
        than necessary and focusing on being exactly true to life. Although I am
        proud of the outcome, I enjoy seeing the loss of perfectionistic
        behavior throughout this course and the more free, interpretive
        linework.
